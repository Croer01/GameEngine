# Main Concepts

- The editor is per game, not one instance for multiple games like Unity3D, Godot, Unreal Engine...
- Develop only what I need. In the first version, I developed to many tools that I never use.
- Try to reuse the main Game Engine pieces to develop the Editor. Less code, more maintainable ðŸ˜Š
